atsamd11_pro_micro
==================

Simple board consisting of an Atmel ATSAMD11C14 chip, a micro USB
socket, a voltage regulator, and an SWD header.

I'm excited about the potential of the tiny 14-pin ATAMD11C14 as a USB
interface for various other projects.  Its 16kB code space is a little
small, but it's tiny, costs less than a dollar, and has a crystal-less
USB device built in.  I expect it to work really well when I need a
quick USB interface for some CPLD based project, which is pretty much
all the time, and with any luck it should be able to double as a JTAG
programming interface.
