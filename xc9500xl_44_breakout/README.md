Simple breakout board for an XC9536XL-10VQG44 or XC9572XL-10VQG44 CPLD.

See ../notes/pld_programming_and_jtag.md for programming tips.  This board
uses the Altera JTAG pinout, so be careful wiring up a Xilinx Platform Cable.

## Errata

v1 has 5V and 0V marked the wrong way around on the power pins at the top of the board.
