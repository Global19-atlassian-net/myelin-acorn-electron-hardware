BGA in Two Layers
=================

http://myelin.nz/acorn/bgain2

An attempt to route a 10M08 BGA FPGA using only two copper layers. Unfortunately
also a test to see how little grounding I can get away with! This should at
least let me try to solder and bring up a 10M08 chip, and hopefully the
crosstalk at 2MHz won't be so bad.

PCB ordered at OSHPark 2017-12-28.
