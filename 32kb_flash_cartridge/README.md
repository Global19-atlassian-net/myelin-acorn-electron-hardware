32kb_flash_cartridge
====================

This is a simple Acorn Electron cartridge that provides two 16kB flash
banks using a cheap 128kB SST39SF010A flash chip and a 74HCT00 quad
NAND gate.

I've made various different PCBs for this:

- original version (unreleased): this was based on [Paul Boddie's
  Electron breakout
  cartridge](http://hgweb.boddie.org.uk/AcornElectronCartridge).  This is test

- [pcb-mini](pcb-mini/): This is designed to just barely protrude from
  the Plus 1 when plugged in.

- [pcb-standard](pcb-standard/): This is designed to match the form
  factor of the PCBs used by Acornsoft for its ROM software.  Still
  working on the layout for this one.
